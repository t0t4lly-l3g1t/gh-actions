Activity Types: 
- Spcify which types of certain triggers execute a workflow. 
- Triggers have multiple activity types that can be leveraged. 
- docs: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows

- Using a pull_request event as an example: 
- opened: runs the workflow whenever a PR is opened. 
- synchronize: runs the workflow whenever a new commit is pushed to the HEAD ref of the PR. 
- closed
- assigned
- labeled
- edited
