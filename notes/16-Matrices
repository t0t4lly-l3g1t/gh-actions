Matrices: 
- Allow you to run several variations of the same job. 
EXAMPLE workflow: 

name: My NPM package workflow
on: 
  push:

jobs:
  backwards-compatibility:
    name: ${{ matrix.os }}-${{ matrix.node }} # the os and node vales will be cycled through to create 9 jobs as a result
    strategy::
      matrix:
        node: [14, 16, 18]
        os:
          - ubuntu-latest
          - macos-latest
          - windows-latest
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}

Use case: 
- Run test suits in parallel in multiple node versions before publishing an NPM package ensure backward compatibility. 

WARNING: 
- Each executed job counts towards billing. A Matrix generating 9 jobs of 3min each will lead to a 27min bill.
