Workflow Functions: 
- These are out of the box functions used to model complex behavior

General purpose functions: 
- Provides a set of utility functions to interact with data from multiple contexts and model more complex
behavior, such as more advanced control of the workflow and job execution. 
- contains(): eval if one argument contains another argument. 
- startsWith(): does a string start with something
- endsWith(): does a string end with something
- fromJSON(): used to transform a string into another data type. Can be used to convert variables
from a string to different data types. 
- toJSON(): used to transform some data into a JSON sting. 


Status check functions: 
- Provides a set of functions that allow using the status of the workflow, previous jobs or steps to
define weather a certian job or step should be executed. 
- success(): returns true if everything before the job or step where this function has been called was a success. 
- failure(): returns true if any of the previous steps have failed. 
- always(): always returns true.
- cancelled(): returns true if the workflow was cancelled. 
- IT IS BETTER TO USE !cancelled() as opposed to always() as !cancelled() can be used to execute jobs or steps 
even if previous jobs or steps failed, but to prevent execution in case the workflow is canceled.
