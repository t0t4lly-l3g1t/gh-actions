Workflow Runners

Pro-Tip: Keep VM resources in mind when running commands that rely on parallel execution. 

GitHub Hosted Option:
- These are VMs that execute jobs from workflows. 
- GitHub-hosted runner VMs are the default option. 
- GitHub-hosted runners are a managed service. 
- GitHub-hosted runners are scoped to a job. Steps share the VM but the jobs don't. 
By default each job recieves a clean VM instance. 

Self-hosted: 
- WARNING!!! -> Do not use self-hosted runners on public repos. 
- Run workflows on almost any infra of your choice. 
- Full control over the VM infra
- Not managed so you are responsibil for the management of the VM and infra. 
- Can be added at the repo, org, or enterprise level. 
- Jobs do not nessessarily have to run on a clean instance.
