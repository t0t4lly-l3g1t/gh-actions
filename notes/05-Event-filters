Event Filters: 
- Spcify under which conditions a specific event triggers a workflow. 
- docs: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on (look at types on the right)

If you have a on push event you can have it trigger: 
- branches: specifies which branches must match in order for the workflow to execute. 
- branches_ignore: specifies which branches must not match in order for the workflow to execute. 
- tags
- tags_ignore
- paths
- paths_ignore

EXAMPLE: 

name: Myu NPM package workflow
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # run on any push to the main branch
      - 'releases/**' # run on any branch that starts with releses/ and then anything else. 
    paths-ignore:
      - 'docs/**' # ignore any files in the docs folder. 

jobs:
  node-16-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 22
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test

If there are multiple filters specified all of them must be satisfied for the workflow to run. 
These are "and" conditions and NOT "or" conditions.
