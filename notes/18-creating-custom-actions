Creating Custom Actions: 
- Allows you to write, encapsulate and reuse custom logic in any programming language. 
The 3 types of custom actions are: 

Composit actions: 
- Simple type 
- Used for grouping collections of other actions. 
- May not be enough for complex functionality. 

JavaScript actions:
- Allows writing any type of custom logic
- Allows for useage of "@actions" packages to provide functionality
- Requires knowledge of JS and Node

Docker actions: 
- Allow for writing custom actions in any language. 
- Might be more verbose as only JS supports @actions. 

Common Requirements for the above. 
- All require an actions.yaml file. 
- Must be on its own repo if it is to be reused by other repos.
