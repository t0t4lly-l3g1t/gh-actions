Workflow Inputs: 
- Provide information to customize workflows and actions. 
- Inputs enable us to request specific information form the workflow or action caller and use this 
information at runtime. 
Example:

Github Action: 

inputs:
  url:
    description: '...'
    required: true
  max-trials:
    description: '...'
    required: false
    default: '60'

- Inputs must be defined in the definition of reusable workflows or custom actions so that they can be used correctly. 

Caller making use of the above input definitions: 
jobs:
  job1:
    steps:
      - name: Ping URL
        uses: ping-url-example@v1
        with: # this is the key used to interact with defined inputs. 
          url: https://www.google.com
          max-trials: 10

- Use Cases include providing information such as target runtime version, caching keys, ...
