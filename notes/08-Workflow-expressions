Workflow Expressions: 
- This is how you use dynamic values and expressions in workflows. 
- Can be used to reference informaiotn from multiple sources within a workflow. 
- Must use the ${{ <expression here> }} syntax. 
- Can be any combo of
- literal values: stings, numbers, bool, and null. 
- context values: values passed via the many workflow contexts that exist. 
- functions: built in functions provided by GitHub actions. 
- Expressions also support the use of operators like !, <, >, !=, &&, || and others.
