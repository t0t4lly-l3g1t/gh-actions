Environments (env): 
- Create muclipe envs with different rules to execute deployments with different rules. 
- You can control things such as required approvers, branch restricitons, and variables. 

Example workflow: 

on:
  push:
    branches: main

jobs: 
  welcome:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: prod
    steps:
     - run: echo "Hi, ${{ vars.FIRST_NAME }}"

Remember: Environment variables are available in the vars context, while secrets are available in the secrets context. 

Use Case: You can use multiple github actions environments to require manual approvals before deploying to 
higher envs.
