- These values can be primatives like a sting, bool, or int. 
- A nested dict example would be a confic with a path and an env. 

config:
  path: first-dir/file.yaml
  environment: staging

Array:

- Example of an array that contains colors. 
- Values in the array can be mixed: string, int, bool. 
- Not the entries in the array start with a "-"
- You can also have arrays of objects. 
- The array can also be nested as needed. 

colors: # an array of colors
  - name: red # first value in the array.
    hex: ff0000
    lables: # an array of labels
      - experimenatl  # first value in the array.
