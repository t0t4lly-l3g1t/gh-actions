Workflow Variables: 
- Use variables to set and reuse non-sensitive config information. 
- Best pract is to write variables in ALL CAPS so they are easy to identify. 

Single workflow behavior: 
- In a single workflow variables can be set at the workflow, job and step level using "env:"
If the variable with the exact same names are set then:
- Variables set at the step level override variables set at the job level
- Variables at the job level override vatiables set at the workflow level
- If the variable names are different then the behave in the context of where they are set. 
- The variables are access using the syntax ${{ env.NAME-OF-VARIABLE-GOES-HERE }}

Multiple Workflow behavior: 
- Variables used by multiple workflows can be set at the organization, repo, and env level. 
- Variables with the exact same name will override in the following order. Variables set at the env level override 
variables at the repo level, and variables set at the repo level override variables set at the org level. 
- If the variables have different names then they behave in the context where they are set. 
- The variables are access using the syntax ${{ vars.NAME-OF-VARIABLE-GOES-HERE }}
