GitHub actions are made up of: 
- Workflows
- Jobs
- Steps 

Workflows: 
- defined at the repo level. 
- define what triggers start the workflow. 
- workflows are composed of one or more jobs. 

Jobs: 
- jobs are defined at the workflow level. 
- define in which execution env they are run. 
- composed of one or more steps. 
- by DEFAULT jobs are run in paralell (unless you specify dependencies on other jobs)

Steps: 
- defined at the job level. 
- define the actual script or GitHub action that will be executed. 
- run sequentially by default. 

example: 

name: My workflow
on: push

jobs:
  my-first-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Hello World"
  my-second-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "buh-bye"
